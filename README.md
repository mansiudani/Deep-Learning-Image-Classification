Thoracic Diseases Classification of Chest X-Ray Images employing Deep Learning Methods

Developed a deep learning neural network (CNN) for classifying multiple diseases from the chest X-ray images dataset which consists of 1,12,000 images by training the model with disease patterns. The popular architectures VGG16 and MobileNet are used for building the model by using appropriate activation and loss functions, Max pooling and Average pooling layers with an optimizer to compile the models. In prior to building convolutional layers, normalization and one-hot encoding methods are performed on all images to normalize the data.
